What is a food & Job desert?
At Get Healthy Dallas, we define any locale where residents face limited access to fresh, healthy food as a food desert.
•In 2011 the United States Department of Agriculture (U.S.D.A.) has labeled half of South Dallas a food desert.

•USDA’s Definition of Food Desert: “Food deserts are defined as parts of the country vapid of fresh fruit, vegetables, and other healthful whole foods, usually found in impoverished areas. This is largely due to a lack of grocery stores, farmers’ markets, and healthy food providers.”

•Known effects of Urban Food Deserts: Recent studies conducted by U.S.D.A. of urban food deserts found these neighborhoods are often short on fresh food providers, especially fresh fruits and vegetables. Instead, they are heavy on local quickie marts that provide a wealth of processed, sugar, and fat laden foods that are known contributors to our nation’s obesity epidemic.

According to the National Association of State Community Services, transportation by low-income individuals and families has become limited in low-income areas of central cities, while basic amenities are increasingly located in the suburbs. With new jobs emerging further and further away from central cities, many low-income workers often have difficulty accessing jobs, training and other services such as childcare because of inadequate transportation.
